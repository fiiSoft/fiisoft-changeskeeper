# FiiSoft ChangesKeeper

`ChangesKeeper` is a class to track changes of values hold by variables and retrieve them as a list of changes.

Additionaly it has component ChangesHistoryGenerator to produce list of messages that describe those changes. 

My advice is - do not use it unless you are enough strong mentally to immune for such bad code. 
But of course you can if you want.
